 🧠 Digital Mind Mirror

 AI-Powered Emotional Growth & Psychological Analytics Platform



📌 Overview

Digital Mind Mirror is an AI-powered journaling and emotional analytics system that transforms daily thoughts into structured psychological insights.

Unlike traditional journaling applications that only store text, this platform analyzes emotional tone, detects stress patterns, and visualizes mental growth trends over time. The goal is to convert unstructured reflections into measurable emotional analytics.

This project explores the practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in mental wellness tracking.



 🚀 Problem Statement

Students and young professionals experience emotional fluctuations, stress, and productivity challenges, yet most available tools do not provide structured analysis of emotional growth.

Current journaling platforms:

Digital Mind Mirror addresses this gap by integrating AI-based sentiment analysis with data visualization.
